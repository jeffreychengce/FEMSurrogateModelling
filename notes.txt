    Setup Linux and cuda for jax 
    Started testing 2D MPM code
    Finished debugging node and particle initialization
    Need to implement correct stress updates from particle.tcc (C++ learning curve)

    mpm_explicit

    week of 4/10 ok? Midterm next week, spring break week after, prelim week after

    status func for computing kinematics?
    unsure about shape functions
    tried to implement 2D as closely as possible
    boundary conditions?
