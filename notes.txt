    Setup Linux and cuda for jax 
    Started testing 2D MPM code
    Finished debugging node and particle initialization
    Need to implement correct stress updates from particle.tcc (C++ learning curve)

    mpm_explicit

    week of 4/10 ok? Midterm next week, spring break week after, prelim week after

    status func for computing kinematics?
    unsure about shape functions
    tried to implement 2D as closely as possible
    boundary conditions?


E_true = 100
true_mesh = Mesh1D(13, Material(E_true, 1), 25, jnp.array([0]))
    
init_vel = jnp.ones(len(true_mesh.particles.x)) * 0.1
true_mesh.set_particle_velocity(init_vel)
dt = 0.02
nsteps = 2500
duration = int(dt * nsteps)
target = true_mesh.solve_jit(nsteps=nsteps, dt=dt, mpm_scheme="USF")
target_vel = target["velocity"][6]
